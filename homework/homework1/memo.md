**TO:** Head of Capital Planning, MTA

**FROM:** Kevin Zhang

**DATE:** August 15, 2025

**SUBJECT:** A Smarter, Data-Driven Way to Fix Our Subway Signals

Hi there,

We all know our subway system is the lifeblood of the city, but the constant delays are wearing everyone thin. While there isn't one single cause, it's clear that our aging signal system is a major source of the problem, causing frustrating disruptions for millions of riders every week.

I'm proposing a project to take a deep dive into the MTA's own performance data. The goal is to create a "hotspot" map that shows us exactly which lines and locations are suffering the most from signal-related failures. Instead of working off of assumptions, we can use data to see the true scope of the problem.

My aim is to deliver a simple, interactive dashboard for your department. This tool will let you see where the problems are, helping you make those tough decisions about where to invest in upgrades. Itâ€™s all about making sure that every dollar spent is going to the place where it can have the biggest positive impact on the daily commute for New Yorkers.

I'm confident this approach can give us the clear, actionable insights we need to start making real progress.

Happy to chat more about this whenever you have a moment.

Best,

Kevin Zhang
